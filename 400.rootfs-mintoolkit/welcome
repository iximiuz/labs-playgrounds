Welcome to iximiuz Labs' minT(oolkit) Playground! ðŸš€

minT(oolkit), formerly known as DockerSlim, is an open-source tool for
building optimized container images. Don't change anything in your
container image and minify it by up to 30x (and for compiled languages
even more) making it more secure, too!

Getting started:

- Run `mint` with no arguments to activate the interactive mode.
- Check out the `~/mintoolkit/examples` directory for examples.
- Try minifying the stock Nginx container image:

```
# ~180MB
docker images nginx

mint build nginx

# ~15MB
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx.slim

curl http://localhost:8080
```
