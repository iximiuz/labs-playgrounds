Welcome to iximiuz Labs' Kubernetes Client (Go) Playground! ðŸš€

This playground contains a collection of mini-programs demonstrating
usage of the Kubernetes Go client library (client-go).

- CRUD operations on Kubernetes objects.
- YAML & JSON serialization/deserialization.
- Watching of Kubernetes objects.
- Workqueue - the basis of controllers development.
- Retries, timeouts, dealing with KUBECONFIG, and more.

All examples are runnable and tested against a local K3s cluster.
Click on the IDE tab to get started.

Playground VMs are ephemeral and short-lived â€” terminating a VM purges
all data, including images in the private registry. Please, do not use
playgrounds for processing critical or sensitive information.
