Welcome to iximiuz Labs' Incus Playground! ðŸš€

Started as a community fork of (now Canonical's) LXD project,
Incus is a container and VM manager that provides a unified
experience for running and managing full Linux systems inside
containers or VMs.

```
# Launch containers
incus launch images:ubuntu/22.04 first
incus launch images:alpine/edge second

# Execute a command in a container
incus exec first -- bash
incus exec second -- uname -a

# Stop and delete a container
incus stop first
incus delete first
```

Playground VMs are ephemeral and short-lived â€” terminating a VM purges
all data, including images in the private registry. Please, do not use
playgrounds for processing critical or sensitive information.
