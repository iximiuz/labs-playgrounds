# iximiuz Labs' Playground Build Tools and Bake Recipes

A curated collection of Dockerfile-based root filesystem images designed for hands-on learning, experimentation, and development across various technologies and platforms.
These images are used by [iximiuz Labs' base playgrounds](https://labs.iximiuz.com/playgrounds),
and provided here to serve as a reference implementation and an extension point for your own custom playgrounds. You can:

- Use these images as a rootfs sources for your own playgrounds
- Fork, modify, and bake your own images to be used as "external" sources for your custom iximiuz Labs playgrounds
- Base your own custom images `FROM` the official [`ghcr.io/iximiuz/labs/rootfs` images](https://github.com/users/iximiuz/packages/container/package/labs%2Frootfs)

## Overview

This repository contains containerized root filesystems organized into tiers based on complexity and specialization:

- **100-series**: Base operating system images
- **200-series**: Container runtime environments
- **300-series**: Development environments and specialized setups
- **400-series**: Advanced tooling and orchestration platforms

Each image is optimized for educational purposes with pre-installed tools, configurations, and utilities to accelerate learning and experimentation.

## Quick Start

### Build Images Locally

```bash
# Set release version
export RELEASE=private

# Build a specific image
make build-rootfs-ubuntu-24-04

# Build all images in a tier
make base-1xx  # Base OS images
make base-2xx  # Container runtimes
make base-3xx  # Development environments
```

## Build System

The project uses a Makefile-based build system:

### Environment Variables

```bash
export RELEASE=private
export IMAGE_REPOSITORY=your-registry
```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build individual images
make build-rootfs-<image-name>

# Build by tier
make base-1xx    # All 100-series images
make base-2xx    # All 200-series images
make base-3xx    # All 300-series images
make base-4xx    # All 400-series images

# Build and push all images
make all

# Clean up
make clean-all
```
