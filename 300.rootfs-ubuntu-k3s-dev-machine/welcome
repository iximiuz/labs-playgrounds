Additional services at your disposal:

* Port publishing: Showcase your app with its own public URL.
* Terminal sharing: Collaborate seamlessly by sharing your terminal session.
* registry.iximiuz.com: A private hub to push and pull container images.

Playground VMs are ephemeral and short-lived â€” terminating a VM purges
all data, including images in the private registry. Please, do not use
playgrounds for processing critical or sensitive information.
