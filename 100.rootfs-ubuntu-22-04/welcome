Welcome to iximiuz Labs' Ubuntu 22.04 Playground! ðŸš€

This is a refined Ubuntu VM, curated with tools for efficient learning and
hands-on experimenting:

- vim, fzf, ripgrep: Command-line file editing and searching.
- fx, jq, yq: Powerful JSON and YAML viewers and processors.
- curl, socat, websocat: A comprehensive networking toolkit.
- arkade: An efficient installer for additional tools you might require.

Additional services at your disposal:

* Port publishing: Showcase your app with its own public URL.
* Terminal sharing: Collaborate seamlessly by sharing your terminal session.
* registry.iximiuz.com: A private hub to push and pull container images.

Playground VMs are ephemeral and short-lived â€” terminating a VM purges
all data, including images in the private registry. Please, do not use
playgrounds for processing critical or sensitive information.
