Welcome to iximiuz Labs' Kamal Playground! ðŸš€

Basecamp's Kamal is a simple but powerful tool to deploy containerized apps to
remote servers via SSH. Kamal uses an imperative model, doesn't require
installation on the target servers, and can leverage almost any IaaS provider
or on-premises infrastructure.

This is a multi-node playground with the following VMs:

- dev-machine: your "local" machine with `kamal` CLI installed.
- server-{01,02}: target VMs to deploy your apps with `kamal`.

Get started with a simple web app:

```
cd ~/svc-a
kamal setup

curl -H 'Host: svc-a-web' 172.16.0.3  # server-01
curl -H 'Host: svc-a-web' 172.16.0.4  # server-02
```

Playground VMs are ephemeral and short-lived â€” terminating a VM purges
all data, including images in the private registry. Please, do not use
playgrounds for processing critical or sensitive information.
