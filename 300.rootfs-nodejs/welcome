Welcome to iximiuz Labs' Node.js Programming Playground! ðŸš€

Get a disposable Node.js development environment in seconds.

Batteries included:

- VS Code: A powerful web IDE with Node.js addons installed.
- Docker: No dev environment is complete without them.
- vim, fzf, ripgrep: Command-line file editing and searching.

Additional services at your disposal:

* Port publishing: Showcase your app with its own public URL.
* Terminal sharing: Collaborate seamlessly by sharing your terminal session.
* registry.iximiuz.com: A private hub to push and pull container images.

Playground VMs are ephemeral and short-lived â€” terminating a VM purges
all data, including images in the private registry. Please, do not use
playgrounds for processing critical or sensitive information.
