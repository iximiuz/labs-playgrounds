Welcome to iximiuz Labs' Docker Swarm Playground! ðŸš€

This is a multi-node sandbox with the batteries included:

- manager VM: Docker Swarm manager node.
- worker VMs: Docker Swarm worker nodes.
- registry.iximiuz.com: private and ephemeral Docker registry.
- dive, regctl, crane, arkade, and other tools pre-installed.

Get started with a simple service:

```
docker service create \
  --replicas 3 \
  --publish published=80,target=80 \
  nginx

curl 127.0.0.1
```
